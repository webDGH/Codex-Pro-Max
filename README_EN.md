codex-pro-max is an external enhancement launcher and manager for the Codex App. It does not modify the original Codex installation. Instead, it starts Codex externally and injects enhancements through the Chromium DevTools Protocol.

## Quick Start

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/webDGH/Codex-Pro-Max/releases):

- Windows: `CodexProMax-*-windows-x64-setup.exe`
- macOS Intel: `CodexProMax-*-macos-x64.dmg`
- macOS Apple Silicon: `CodexProMax-*-macos-arm64.dmg`

After installation, two entry points are available:

- `codex-pro-max`: a silent launcher. It does not show the manager UI and only starts Codex with codex-pro-max injection.
- `codex-pro-max Manager`: a Tauri control panel for launch, diagnostics, repair, updates, relay injection, enhancements, and user scripts.

The Windows installer creates desktop and Start Menu shortcuts. The macOS DMG installs `/Applications/codex-pro-max.app` and `/Applications/codex-pro-max 管理工具.app`.

## Highlights

- Rust backend and silent launcher with no extra runtime requirement.
- Tauri + React manager with dark/light theme support.
- External CDP injection. No `app.asar` patching and no DLL writes into the Codex installation.
- Relay injection mode with multiple relay profiles, `CodexProMax` provider configuration, and a one-click switch back to official ChatGPT login mode.
- Traditional enhancement mode with plugin entry unlock, forced plugin install, session delete, Markdown export, project move, Timeline, and more.
- Independent user script management with startup injection.
- Provider Sync to keep historical sessions visible after switching providers.
- Zed open entry detects remote SSH context and opens the matching remote file in Zed Remote Development from Codex.
- Upstream worktree creation: create new worktrees from `upstream/<base-branch>` after fetching the remote branch, reducing conflicts caused by stale local HEAD state.
- GitHub Release updates. Both the manager and silent launcher can detect available updates.
- Windows single instance, no console window, administrator manifest, and system Desktop path detection.
- Separate macOS x64 and arm64 DMGs. The silent launcher hides its Dock icon.

## Relay Injection

Relay injection is for users who are already logged in with an official ChatGPT account in Codex/ChatGPT and want model requests to go through a custom compatible API.

In the manager's Relay Injection page:

1. Make sure ChatGPT login status is detected.
2. Add one or more relay profiles with Base URL and Key.
3. Select the active profile and apply relay injection.
4. Launch `codex-pro-max`.

codex-pro-max writes configuration similar to this into `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_provider = "CodexProMax"

[model_providers.CodexProMax]
name = "CodexProMax"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
base_url = "https://example.com/v1"
experimental_bearer_token = "sk-..."
```

To return to the official login mode, use the clear API mode button in the Relay Injection page. This removes `OPENAI_API_KEY` related configuration and switches Codex back to official ChatGPT authentication.

## Enhancements

Enhancements are controlled in the manager. Enhancement injection is enabled by default. When disabled, codex-pro-max will not inject its menu or scripts.

When relay injection mode is active, plugin entry unlock and forced plugin install are unnecessary, and the UI will say so. Other enhancements, including session delete, export, move, Timeline, recommendations, and user scripts, can still be used.

## Updates and Packages

codex-pro-max publishes installers through GitHub Releases. Windows builds an NSIS installer, while macOS builds separate Intel x64 and Apple Silicon arm64 DMGs.

The manager's About page can check and start updates. When the silent launcher finds a new version, it opens the manager directly on the update prompt.

## Data Locations

- Codex config: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Codex auth state: `~/.codex/auth.json`
- Codex local database: `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`
- codex-pro-max state and logs: `~/.codex-session-delete/`
- Provider Sync backups: `~/.codex/backups_state/provider-sync`

## FAQ

### The codex-pro-max menu does not appear

Make sure Codex was launched from the `codex-pro-max` entry instead of the original Codex entry. You can also inspect the Diagnostics and Logs pages in the manager.

### The plugin says the backend is disconnected

First test the helper endpoint:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:57321/backend/status -Body "{}" -ContentType "application/json"
```

If the endpoint works but the plugin still times out, it is usually a Codex page CDP bridge or script cache issue. Restart codex-pro-max, or check manager logs for `renderer.script_loaded`, `bridge.request`, and `bridge.response`.

### How is Upstream worktree different from Codex native creation?

codex-pro-max updates the remote branch first, then creates the worktree as if you ran:

```bash
git worktree add -b <new-branch> <worktree-path> upstream/<base-branch>
```

The new worktree starts from the fresh remote tracking branch instead of the local HEAD used by the current session. If codex-pro-max cannot safely recognize the current Codex version's native worktree form, use the codex-pro-max menu entry and enter the repository path, branch name, worktree path, remote, and base branch manually.

### macOS says the app cannot be opened or is damaged

Unsigned and unnotarized builds may be blocked by Gatekeeper. Allow the app in System Settings -> Privacy & Security. For formal distribution, configure Apple Developer ID signing and notarization.

### Does it support Intel Macs?

Yes. Releases provide both `macos-x64.dmg` and `macos-arm64.dmg`. Intel Macs should use the x64 package, while Apple Silicon Macs should use the arm64 package.

## Development

## Notes

codex-pro-max is an external enhancement tool and does not modify original Codex App files. If a future Codex App update changes page structure, the injection script may need updates.
